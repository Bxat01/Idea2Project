# Idea2Project
Idea2Project – AI-Powered Project Idea Translator for Developers  Idea2Project is an AI-powered platform designed to help developers transform their programming skills into practical, well-structured software project ideas.
The platform is built around a custom AI model trained specifically for this project, focused on understanding:

Programming languages selected by the user

Developer experience level (Beginner – Intermediate – Advanced)

Preferred project type and learning goals

Based on these inputs, Idea2Project generates a tailored project proposal, including:

A unique and non-repetitive project idea

A clear and structured project description

Suggested features and system components

A proposed database schema

A step-by-step implementation roadmap

Idea2Project aims to solve a common problem among developers:

“I know how to code, but I don’t know what to build.”

🚧 Project Status:
This project is currently under active development. Core features and AI logic are being continuously improved, with future plans to expand the recommendation engine and introduce more advanced AI-driven capabilities.

The platform is intended for students, self-taught developers, and professionals who want to:
